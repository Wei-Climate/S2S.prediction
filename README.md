# S2S.prediction: Research Project on Subseasonal-to-seasonal Climate Prediction

Background: 
- Subseasonal climate prediction has become the "new frontier" of climate forecasting in recent years.
- There are increasing demands for subseasonal prediction, particularly week 3-4 outlooks that can bridge the gap between weather forecast & seasonal prediciton. 
- Skillful subseasonal prediction provides immense socialeconomic benefits for harzard preparedness and risk management, given the increased frequency and 	intensity of severe weahter and climate disaster events. 

Main Objectives: 
- To understand the limits of and mechanisms for subseasonal predictability.
- To examine subseasonal predictability of both mean state climate and extreme climate events. 
- To diagnose sources of subseasonal predictability, including the Maddenâ€“Julian oscillation (MJO), Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO), North Atlantic Oscillation(NAO), and Atmospheric River (AR). 
- To improve subseasonal forecast skill and understanding on high-impact weather/climate events.  
- To provide robust real-time forecasts 3-4 weeks ahead for effective disaster preparedness and risk management. 

Length of Project: Two Years from 2020/09 to 2022/09
